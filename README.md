# Quiz Game
 Quiz game is a site that hopes to demonstrate how pure JavaScript works in a real-world context. The site will be targeted toward people who not only love to implement more advanced JavaScript concepts but also general knowledge questions. Quiz Game is a fully responsive JavaScript Quiz Game that will allow users to challenge their general knowledge. It does this by asking the user of the website 6 random general knowledge quiz questions.

### Features Left to Implement

- Another feature idea for the future of the website is to do add more questions if the user gets them all correct.

## Testing 

- The website has been tested numerous times to make sure the user has an easy and enjoyable experience, along the project i opened the website in the browser and used devtools to check everything was running smoothly. I Also used console.log to make sure certain elements of the quiz were being logged and working with the computer.

## Questions & Answers
- Starting with the questions and answers, i had a slight issue at the start with displaying the answers as during the start i had both the answer buttons i created in html and also there answers i had created in javascript, after putting the answers into the correct function i was able to over come this.
- 
## Submit Button
- I then also had issues with my submit button, i was able to display the submit button in the browser but it wouldnt work, I overcame this problem by instead of a submit button i used an event listner when the user clicked there answer along with display/block so that the user wasnt able to change there answer once chosen.
  

### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator]https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Folutobi1996.github.io%2Fpure-souls%2F 
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw)]https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Folutobi1996.github.io%2Fpure-souls%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=envalidator#warnings)

### Unfixed Bugs
There were no unfixed bugs in the final code but for days i had W3C validator show i had a "parse erorr" problem with my footer tag. For days i spent trying to solve problem on my own by using google and looking back through the project "love running", but still had no luck. So in the end with help from my tutor and slack team we solved the problem, it was simple error of putting footer tag within the body tag.

## Deployment

  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the main branch
  - Once the main branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
